limit to how many activist clusters there can be in the
world. Below are some instructions on how we did it. Of
course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We
want to share our experiences.</p> <h3 id="throw-a-party-with-friends"><a href="#throw-a-party-with-friends" class="header-anchor">#</a> Throw a party with friends</h3> <p>Throw a party with friends who share similar interests.
Cook some food if you like, or buy some beer, it is up to
what you prefer. Make sure you have internet connectivity
and encourage people to bring laptops. Play music. Or, if
you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or internet
cafe that you can meet in and bring your laptops too.</p> <h3 id="start-and-irc-discord-telegram"><a href="#start-and-irc-discord-telegram" class="header-anchor">#</a> Start and IRC/Discord/Telegram</h3> <p>Start an IRC/Discord/Telegam and spread all over the internet
that this is the place where stuff happens.</p> <h3 id="gather-friends-with-various-skills"><a href="#gather-friends-with-various-skills" class="header-anchor">#</a> Gather friends with various skills</h3> <p>Gather friends with various skills. You will need coders
as well as philosophers, people who know politics and people
who know Photoshop (or GIMP, because it's free :p ). Make
sure your friends know also how to have <strong>#FUN</strong>, since otherwise
you won't get anything done. Activism is not rocket science,
so just spread out skills. Think multiplicity rather than
expertise!</p> <h3 id="register-sites-with-cool-names"><a href="#register-sites-with-cool-names" class="header-anchor">#</a> Register sites with cool names</h3> <p>Register sites with cool names, like Werebuild.eu and
Telecomix.org. Make sure people can find you easily. Write
with slogans.</p> <h3 id="become-friends-with-important-people"><a href="#become-friends-with-important-people" class="header-anchor">#</a> Become friends with important people</h3> <p>Become friends with important people. Contact politicians,
bureaucrats, presidents, corporations, other activists,
hackers, artists, etc. Do not have principles for selecting
beforehand whom you speak to. Flirt a lot, but never do
anything you would regret. Build trust, and make sure you
work together. Politicians will need your votes, corporations
will need your consumption. Understand that you are important,
but do not become too self-important. Do things like watch
movies together to keep your feet on the ground.</p> <h3 id="install-mediawiki-wordpress-and-use-evernote"><a href="#install-mediawiki-wordpress-and-use-evernote" class="header-anchor">#</a> Install Mediawiki, Wordpress and use Evernote</h3> <p>Install Mediawiki, Wordpress and use Evernote. Also,
fill your IRC/Discord/Telegram with bots. Share all data. Do not
respect copyright! Do copy all floppies.</p> <h3 id="throw-more-parties"><a href="#throw-more-parties" class="header-anchor">#</a> Throw more parties</h3> <p>Throw more parties. Invent vocabularies. Speak like lolcats.
Make music together, even if it sounds strange.</p> <h3 id="if-you-run-into-internet-trolls"><a href="#if-you-run-into-internet-trolls" class="header-anchor">#</a> If you run into Internet trolls</h3> <p>If you run into Internet trolls, troll back or make sure
you kick them off your side of the internets. Or, be cooler
than them, and make them join you (see, Troll them back) Do not
let them make you sad.</p> <h3 id="start-new-political-campaigns-often"><a href="#start-new-political-campaigns-often" class="header-anchor">#</a> Start new political campaigns often</h3> <p>Start new political campaigns often. Call them raids,
operations, projects or any word of choice. Write instructions
and tutorials. Make sure a total newbie can understand what
you are going to do. Synchronize your work. Countdown just
like a space shuttle takeoff.</p> <h3 id="get-together-a-list-of-clear-and-simple-talking-points"><a href="#get-together-a-list-of-clear-and-simple-talking-points" class="header-anchor">#</a> Get together a list of clear and simple talking points</h3> <p>Get together a list of clear and simple talking points,
in the event that you have to &quot;present&quot; on the fly. Make
sure that you have a few easy-to remember facts to back up
your statements. Make t-shirts to spur conversations with
random people on the streets. Rent an airplane with a banner
behind it to get an entire city asking &quot;who/what was that.&quot;
Then station people on street corners to explain. Send
people to the moon and spraypaint your URL on the surface. ❤️</p> <h3 id="install-an-artificial-intelligence-bot"><a href="#install-an-artificial-intelligence-bot" class="header-anchor">#</a> Install an artificial intelligence bot</h3> <p>Install an artificial intelligence bot. Ours is called Cameron. Ask her lots of things. Quote Cameron
in your conversations.</p> <h3 id="translate-stuff-to-other-languages"><a href="#translate-stuff-to-other-languages" class="header-anchor">#</a> Translate stuff to other languages</h3> <p>Translate stuff to other languages. Remember that the
Internet does not care about nation states. You never know
who will join you if you go internetional. Stamp your internet
visa in your passport.</p> <h3 id="statements-are-not-only-for-stating-things"><a href="#statements-are-not-only-for-stating-things" class="header-anchor">#</a> Statements are not only for stating things</h3> <p>Statements are not only for stating things. Statements
also makes things harder to forget. By sending out messages
of events, activities and other tips you make them unforgettable
and eternal. For instance, by making public reminders to people
with power, you can change their agenda.</p> <h3 id="even-if-you-are-fighting-against-horrible-laws"><a href="#even-if-you-are-fighting-against-horrible-laws" class="header-anchor">#</a> Even if you are fighting against horrible laws</h3> <p>Even if you are fighting against horrible laws, even if
your mission seems impossible to accomplish â€“ do not be sad!
Lulz are as important as change. Your goal can be serious
even if you do it for the lulz. Remember to smile when you

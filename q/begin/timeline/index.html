and mystical thinkers into a trap, where &quot;old fag&quot; Anons could uncover, and ruin, the
supporters of pseudoscience and love. You will find many references to Satan hidden,
and sometimes not so hidden, inside the literature and images of Project Mayhem 2012,
because SOME (not all) of the founders are satanists. Some founders viewed the satanic imagery
as simply the empowerment of the human spirit, while a select few saw this as a symbol for evil.

Conspiracy theorizing is a rhetorical meme that transforms scientific controversies into human dramas with villains who can be exposed. It uses controversial facts and speculations to undermine scientific evidence.</p> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/650367851781292054/662679503104901120/conspiracy-meme.jpg" alt="Conspiracy Meme"></p> <p>Conspiracy theories are easy to propagate and difficult to refute. Having long flourished in politics and religion, they have also spread into science and medicine. It is useful to think of conspiracy theorizing as a meme, a cultural invention that passes from one mind to another and thrives, or declines, through a process analogous to genetic selection (Dawkins 1976). The conspiracy meme competes with other rhetorical memes, such as the fair debate meme, the scientific expertise meme, and the resistance to orthodoxy meme.</p> <h2 id="📅-2010"><a href="#📅-2010" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 2010</h2> <h3 id="ron-rewald"><a href="#ron-rewald" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ron Rewald</h3> <p>In 2010, Rewald lived in Los Angeles and worked as director of operations for the APA talent agency in Beverly Hills. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rewald" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h4 id="agency-for-the-performing-arts"><a href="#agency-for-the-performing-arts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Agency for the Performing Arts</h4> <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2016/06/15/kardashians-sued-talent-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ: Kardashians Sued<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its source code was released as open-source software.</p> <p>Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, its high electricity consumption, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several Nobel laureates, have characterized it as a speculative bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.</p> <p>On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the first block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text &quot;The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&quot;.</p> <p>The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold.

Something radically new is in the air: new ways of understanding physical systems, new ways of thinking about thinking that call into question many of our basic assumptions.  A realistic biology of the mind, advances in evolutionary biology, physics, information technology, genetics, neurobiology, psychology, engineering, the chemistry of materials: all are questions of critical importance with respect to what it means to be human. For the first time, we have the tools and the will to undertake the scientific study of human nature.</p> <p>What you will find emerging out of the 119 original essays in the 75,000 word document written in response to the 2006 Edge Question — &quot;What is your dangerous idea?&quot; — are indications of a new natural philosophy, founded on the realization of the import of complexity, of evolution. Very complex systems — whether organisms, brains, the biosphere, or the universe itself — were not constructed by design; all have evolved. There is a new set of metaphors to describe ourselves, our minds, the universe, and all of the things we know in it.</p> <p>Welcome to Edge. Welcome to &quot;dangerous ideas&quot;.

4chan is an anonymous English-language imageboard website. Launched by Christopher Poole in October 2003, the site was created as a counterpart to the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel, also known as 2chan. The site has been described as a hub of Internet subculture, with 4chan's community being influential in the formation and spread of prominent Internet memes, including lolcats, Rickrolling, and rage comics, as well as activist and political movements, such as Anonymous and the alt-right.</p> <h4 id="b-ees-lulz"><a href="#b-ees-lulz" class="header-anchor">#</a> /b/ees Lulz</h4> <p>The humor of /b/'s many users, who refer to themselves as &quot;/b/tards&quot;, is often incomprehensible to newcomers and outsiders, and is characterized by intricate inside jokes and dark comedy. Users often refer to each other, and much of the outside world, as fags. They are often referred to by outsiders as trolls, who regularly act with the intention of &quot;doing it for the lulz&quot;, a corruption of &quot;LOL&quot; used to denote amusement at another's expense.[</p> <p>Many early memes—catchphrases or images that spread quickly, peer to peer, across the Internet have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, crowd psychology nature enabled content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.</p> <h4 id="adult-fandom"><a href="#adult-fandom" class="header-anchor">#</a> Adult Fandom</h4> <p>The adult fandom and subculture dedicated to the children's animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic began on the &quot;Comics &amp; Cartoons&quot; (/co/) board of 4chan. The show was first discussed with some interest around its debut in October 2010.</p> <h4 id="jeffrey-epstein"><a href="#jeffrey-epstein" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jeffrey Epstein</h4> <p>A report of Jeffrey Epstein's death was posted on /pol/ around 40 minutes before ABC News broke the news. The unidentified person who made the posts may have been a first responder, in violation of privacy law. The posts are under review.</p> <h4 id="starting-point-for-anonymous"><a href="#starting-point-for-anonymous" class="header-anchor">#</a> Starting point for Anonymous</h4> <p>4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the Anonymous meme by The Baltimore City Paper, due to the norm of posts signed with the &quot;Anonymous&quot; moniker. The National Post's David George-Cosh said it has been &quot;widely reported&quot; that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and 711chan, as well as numerous Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels.</p> <h4 id="lolcat"><a href="#lolcat" class="header-anchor">#</a> Lolcat</h4> <p>A lolcat is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect. In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of &quot;Caturday&quot;. Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with image macros relating to that day's theme.</p> <h4 id="chocolate-rain"><a href="#chocolate-rain" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chocolate Rain</h4> <p>A link to the YouTube video of Tay Zonday's song &quot;Chocolate Rain&quot; was posted on /b/ on July 11, 2007.[95] The Age reported that 4chan posters urged each other to &quot;swarm&quot; the video on YouTube and thus increase its ranking. The video became an immensely popular Internet meme, resulting in cover versions by John Mayer and Green Day drummer Tré Cool.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwTZ2xpQwpA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> <p>On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a &quot;Meme Factory&quot; at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site (&quot;The site has no memory.&quot;).</p> <p>On November 29, 2010, Ali Saad, a 19-year-old, was arrested and had his home raided by the FBI for posting child pornography and death threats on 4chan. Ali had first visited 4chan &quot;a week before [the FBI raid] happened&quot;.

This network is an immensely complex, self-organizing system that not only processes information, but increasingly can be seen to play the role of a brain: making decisions, solving problems, learning new connections and discovering new ideas. No individual, organization or computer is in control of this system: its knowledge and intelligence are distributed over all its components. They emerge from the collective interactions between all the human and machine subsystems. Such a system may be able to tackle current and emerging global problems that have eluded more traditional approaches, but at the same time it will create new technological and social challenges which are still difficult to imagine.</p> <p>Apr 25, 2001: <a href="https://goertzel.org/benzine/Bankruptcy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Webmind Inc.

Unlike any other AI system, it forms its own intuitions regarding concepts by dynamically &quot;grounding&quot; linguistic concepts in terms of its own nonlinguistic experience. It is the first AI system able to create its own concepts that apply across different contexts.</p> <p>Derived from a sophisticated, complex-systems-based mathematical theory of intelligence, WebMind's architecture is that of a massively parallel network, a population of many different static and dynamic agents continually recomputing their relationships with other agents, and acting on other agents in accordance with these relationships</p> <p>WebMind runs efficiently on powerful stand-alone computers, but is most powerful when run over a network of computers, in which case its sophisticated server-server communication methods allow its internal network structure to harmonize with the connectivity structure of the computer network.</p> <p>WebMind does not aim to emulate human intelligence in an artificial way, but rather to be a natural intelligence for the digital world -- solving human problems with digital intuition.</p> <h2 id="📅-2000"><a href="#📅-2000" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 2000</h2> <h3 id="edge-org-dinners"><a href="#edge-org-dinners" class="header-anchor">#</a> Edge.org Dinners</h3> <p>There is a group individuals at https://Edge.org that are organized by a publisher John Brockman, whose members include some of the wealthiest and most connected people in the world.

And finally, there is Nathan Myhrvold, &quot;the brain of Gates,&quot; who coordinates comprehensive expeditions on the life of the dinosaurs.</p> <p>As an assistant to Stephen Hawking, Myhrvold witnessed the birth of A Brief History of Time and a new cosmology. &quot;In the past,&quot; he says, &quot;astronomers built tools, and now the bio-computer experts are at last building their new tools.&quot;</p> <p>At this point, it's worth reminding ourselves of Myhrvold's dimensions: the former assistant to Stephen Hawking became a billionaire as Microsoft's key research strategist.</p> <p>The 30-year-old is Ben Goertzel, who has attracted talented people his own age from around the globe to his company to create artificial intelligence for the Internet. The 40-year-old is Nathan Myhrvold, and he gives Goertzel exactly 15 minutes to shape his destiny: &quot;When we raise our baby, we won't talk to it about trees and flowers and teeth, as these are things it will never know. We will talk to it about files and MIDI sequences and shapes, as these are things in which we ourselves and the baby have gathered experience.&quot;</p> <p>This encounter is like the meeting between two artists, the elder celebrity and the rambunctious youngster. The finishing touch would be if Myhrvold were to ask Goertzel what he was working on, as Goethe once asked Heinrich Heine, and Goertzel were to reply: &quot;a version of Faust.&quot;</p> <p>According to Myrvhold, genetic engineering and the development of artificial intelligence are the two main obsessions of America's scientific elite.</p> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/650367851781292054/662691581375283202/epstein-microsoft.jpg" alt="Nathan Myhrvold and Jeffrey Epstein"></p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Nathan Myhrvold</p> <p><a href="https://www.edge.org/memberbio/nathan_myhrvold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edge.org Nathan Myhrvold<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>

When Rewald was left out to dry by the Agency, Willhite planned to publicly protest, but was killed in a place crash before doing so.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00494R001100700099-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIA: Counterspy CIA FRONT<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a><br> <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00494R001100700090-0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIA: Rewald Files Show No Major Link with CIA<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <div class="custom-block danger"><p class="custom-block-title">Warning!</p> <p>This links goes to a PDF file on CIA.gov website, so be warned you will be tracked after looking at this file.</p></div> <h2 id="📅-1982"><a href="#📅-1982" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1982</h2> <h3 id="the-global-brain"><a href="#the-global-brain" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Global Brain</h3> <p><a href="https://www.peterrussell.com/GB/globalbrain.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Brain<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> by Peter Russell</p> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/650367851781292054/662861266284445719/GBFloris.png?width=150&amp;height=225" alt="" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;"> In The Global Brain Peter Russell shows that humanity has reached a crossroads in its evolutionary path.

The Second World War began a true &quot;revolution&quot; in intelligence. The impact of
intelligence on the strategy and tactics of the Allies (and to a somewhat lesser extent on
the Germans and Japanese) was truly revolutionary, and it is just now coming to be
recognized for what it was. Through the publication of books like Frederick
Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret and John Masterman's The Double Cross System and by
the massive declassification of war records begun by the British and Americans in 1977,
the true extent of this influence is now emerging.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k9Lw3L9Q2Righ6DIdhgO3pXE8QaRGavt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book 2: Centralization Wins, 1960-1972<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
John Kennedy came to the White House with an abiding interest in foreign affairs and
defense policy. His politics, forged during formative years of the Cold War, were hard-line
an~i-Comrnunist and anti-Soviet. But unlike Eisenhower, whose instinctive conservatism
drove him toward small government and small defense budgets, Kennedy wanted a liberal
remake of the world. Under the driving and optimistic Kennedy, it seemed that anything
was possible and that John Fitzgerald Kennedy could make it happen.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18XNTFpGybGKVdBewIVv2PidQjw_aFXH4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book 3: Retrenchment and Reform, 1972-1980<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
The cease-fire that took effect in February of 1973 required that all U.S.
military people be out of the country. The cryptOlogic infrastructure was already safely in
Thailand, but the NSA office in Saigon had to remain to provide support to the ambassador xxxx.
Moreover, NSA was committed to advising the South Vietnamese SIGINT service, renamed the
DGTS (Directorate General of Technical Security). There were NSA advisors at each
of the major OGTS field sites and as DoD people, they were technically illegal according to the peace accords.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PmQ_E6F5tKlAo5th9AL_Bru1a8qAIfHc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book 4: Cryptologic Rebirth, 1981-1989<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
Nineteen-eighty marked more than just a change of decade. It was a change of
mood. Some have called it the Reagan Revolution. Reagan, a forever optimistic actor from
California, came to office with a world view in complete contrast with that of the 1970s.
He was tired of talk about limitations, wanted none of the gloom that had settled over the
White House in the late Carter years. He would restore America's power in the world. He
would start by spending the nation back into prosperity.</p> <h3 id="building-20-2"><a href="#building-20-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Building 20</h3> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
Building 20 (18 Vassar Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a temporary wooden structure hastily erected during World War II on the central campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since it was always regarded as &quot;temporary&quot;, it never received a formal name throughout its 55-year existence. The three-floor structure housed the Radiation Laboratory (or &quot;Rad Lab&quot;), where fundamental advances were made in physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles, and which has been called one of America's &quot;two prominent shrines of the triumph of science during the war&quot; (with the desert installation at Los Alamos, where the atomic bomb was born). A former Rad Lab member said, &quot;At one time, more than 20 percent of the physicists in the United States (including nine Nobel Prize winners) had worked in that building&quot;.</p> <p>After the Rad Lab shut down after the end of World War II, Building 20 served as a &quot;magical incubator&quot; for many small MIT programs, research, and student activities for a half-century before it was demolished in 1998.</p> <p>Building 20 was the home of the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. Building 20 also housed one of the first anechoic chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Tech Model Railroad</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
The Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) is a student organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Historically it has been a wellspring of hacker culture and the oldest such hacking group in North America. Formed in 1946, its HO scale layout specializes in automated operation of model trains.</p></div> <h2 id="📅-1946"><a href="#📅-1946" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1946</h2> <h3 id="sage-semi-automatic-ground-environment"><a href="#sage-semi-automatic-ground-environment" class="header-anchor">#</a> SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment)</h3> <p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653819043693985803/660260866318401538/sage.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;"> To develop an automated detection and interception system to protect the entire U.S. from incoming bombers, in 1949, under the name Project Charles, the Air Force funded a project proposed by George Valley and Jay ForresterOffsite Link of MIT to develop a military grade version of the Whirlwind Offsite Link computer. The Final Report of the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee (1950) concluded that the United States was unprepared for the threat of an air attack, and, as a result, in 1951 MIT's Lincoln LaboratoryOffsite Link was founded in Lexington, Massachusetts, as a federally funded research and development center, initially focused on improving the nation's air defense system through advanced electronics.</p> <p>Because of MIT's management of the <strong>Radiation Laboratory Offsite Link</strong>  during World War II, and the experience of some of its staff on the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee, and MIT's proven competence in electronics, the U.S. Air Force recommended that MIT could provide the research needed to develop an air defense that could detect, identify, and ultimately intercept air threats. However, it was soon determined that technology based on the Whirlwind computer, which Valley and Forrester had originally recommended for the purpose, was clearly inadequate. Instead, the project evolved into the huge Semi-Automatic Ground Environment or SAGE system, development of which occurred from 1954 to 1963.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ObXEbh-kq7nSTglw66ZblKg4Yrr32d6U/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAGE Manual<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P2lzL25NtvHuRZmCQ6VUeV_woOqS24qq?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAINT Manuals<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h2 id="📅-1943"><a href="#📅-1943" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1943</h2> <h3 id="sigsaly"><a href="#sigsaly" class="header-anchor">#</a> SIGSALY</h3> <p>1943/1946: In cryptography, SIGSALY (also known as the X System, Project X, Ciphony I, and the Green Hornet) was a secure speech system used in World War II for the highest-level Allied communications.</p> <ul><li>The first conference took place on 15 July 1943, and it was used by both General Dwight D.

That morning he was assigned duty as the Officer In Charge of the partly activated Pearl Harbor Intercept Center. His duties were to assist the controller in ordering planes to intercept foreign planes, after the planes got in the air. New and untrained at the time, when warned of the approach of a large aircraft flight from the north, Tyler presumed it to be the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from the mainland. The radar operators were tracking Japanese planes coming to attack the base. However the operator, operating in training mode, failed to make clear the size of the formation even though it was larger than anything they'd ever seen, and he did not pass on an alarm of &quot;attack imminent&quot;.</p> <p>Following an investigation by a Naval Board of Inquiry in August 1942,[3] it was determined that Tyler had been assigned to the Information Center with little or no training, no supervision, and no staff with which to work. Tyler was subsequently cleared on any wrongdoing by the Board and no disciplinary actions were taken against him.</p> <h2 id="📅-1939"><a href="#📅-1939" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1939</h2> <h3 id="victor-goertzel-visits-mexico"><a href="#victor-goertzel-visits-mexico" class="header-anchor">#</a> Victor Goertzel Visits Mexico</h3> <p>In the late thirties, Victor met his wife-to-be, Mildred George, a schoolteacher, and they traveled to Mexico, He married schoolteacher Mildred George in 1939 after a trip to Mexico where the couple became acquainted with Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, and discovered Quakerism.</p> <h3 id="leon-trotsky"><a href="#leon-trotsky" class="header-anchor">#</a> Leon Trotsky</h3> <p>From January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky and his wife lived in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City at La Casa Azul (The Blue House), the home of the painter Diego Rivera and Rivera's wife and fellow painter, Frida Kahlo, with whom Trotsky had an affair.

Operation Trust was a counterintelligence operation of the State Political Directorate (GPU) of the Soviet Union. The operation, which ran from 1921 to 1926, set up a fake anti-Bolshevik resistance organization, &quot;Monarchist Union of Central Russia&quot;, MUCR, in order to help the OGPU identify real monarchists and anti-Bolsheviks.</p> <p>The Soviets did not organize Trust from scratch. The White Army had left sleeper agents, and there were also Royalist Russians who did not leave after the Civil War. These people cooperated to the point of having a loose organizational structure. When the OGPU discovered them, they did not liquidate them, but expanded the organization for their own use.</p> <p>The one Western historian who had limited access to the Trust files, John Costello, reported that they comprised thirty-seven volumes and were such a bewildering welter of double-agents, changed code names, and interlocking deception operations with &quot;the complexity of a symphonic score&quot;, that Russian historians from the Intelligence Service had difficulty separating fact from fantasy.</p> <h2 id="📅-1921"><a href="#📅-1921" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1921</h2> <h3 id="russian-dissenters"><a href="#russian-dissenters" class="header-anchor">#</a> Russian Dissenters</h3> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/650367851781292054/662692889691684894/unknown.png?width=700&amp;height=210" alt="Russian Dissenter Sects"></p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10aJQCcw4txhPItjDWJQoB6eYjgA7Pc3N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian Dissenters<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> The third group is the Khlysty or flagellants, of which the Skoptsy or self-emasculators are an offshoot, dated by Ivanovski at the middle of the XVIIth Century, though he admits their origin to be obscure and that some features of their teaching go back to remote antiquity, to paganism and old Christian heresies.

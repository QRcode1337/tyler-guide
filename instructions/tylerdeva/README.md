## #IDEAS
TylerDeva works with two basic ideas when following the instructions. #IMAGINE
and #CREATE.  These two ideas are broken out like this because anyone can have
an idea, but some might not be able to create.

### #IMAGINE
*IMAGINE:* **#IDEAS**  
*IMAGINE:* becoming the **#ARTIST** to those **#IDEAS**  
*IMAGINE:* sharing those **#IDEAS** with the **#WORLD**  

*IMAGINE:* the **#IDEAS** are born from **#IMAGINATION**  
*IMAGINE:* bringing the #IDEAS into #REALITY  
*IMAGINE:* we **#DRAW**, **#PAINT**, **#SING**, **#WRITE**, **#CREATE** a new **#Reality**  

*IMAGINE:* finding the **#COURAGE** needed  
*IMAGINE:* we are no longer afraid of **#IDEAS**  

*IMAGINE:* we all synchronize to act in **#HARMONY**  
*IMAGINE:* we thank all of **#CREATION**  

*IMAGINE:* this #IDEA goes **#VIRAL**
just **#IMAGINE**...

### #CREATE
Don't expect to 'evolve the #WORLD' until you have #EVOLVED
yourself. The practice does not need #QUANTITY but #QUALITY

::: tip NOTE
TEN #PEOPLE WHO KNOW WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN A MILLION ARMED #ANARCHISTS.
:::


STOP: being a #PASSIVE #USER  
STOP: feeding negativity into your life: that which you feed, grows.  
START: becoming an #ARTIST  
START: being an #ARTIST  

USE: your #IMAGINATION and #CREATIVITY to #INSPIRE the #FUTURE

STOP: poisoning your mind with bad news/TV/outlooks/etc. We ALL
know the world is pretty messed up, yeah, but tuning your brain into
that sort of negativity is going to help #NOBODY.

START: feeding Consciousness, Beauty and Truth within yourself, towards
the people closest to you and then out into the world.

The shortest and most powerful way to create from #ILLUSION into #REALITY
is to see #BEAUTY all around you and within yourself, all the timE.

LOVE: things and persons for what they are, JUST THE WAY THEY ARE, and
not for what they "look like".

Once you have done this, you'll be #FREE to decide which kind of things
you would like to see #CHANGING.

The shortest and most powerful way to get there is #CREATE the energy
all around you and within yourself, all the #TIME.

---
### #BEAUTY

FEEL: the #BEAUTY

SHARE: your #EXPERIENCES and #CREATIONS with #OTHERS: this is the single
MOST important skill of the #IMAGINATION #ARTIST. #SHARE #CREATIONS with #OTHERS.

#### CREATE: the #SEEDS of something #BEAUTIFUL:
- a wallpaper
- a stencil
- a game
- a video
- a message to the #FUTURE
- #YOU are completely #FREE to choose what to #CREATE.

#### KNOW: that you can begin to Create:
- YOU: have the #TOOLS and #CREATIVITY that you need
- YOU: have the #PASSION to #CREATE and #SHARE beauty with the #WORLD
- YOU: don't need to do #BIG things
- YOU: just have to #START NOW.

- WILL: to become a #REALITY #CREATOR by #ACTIVELY #CREATING your
transformation from a #PASSIVE #USER to an #ACTIVE #ARTIST of #REALITY.

- STOP: being #SILENT: #SHARE the #EXPERIENCE that you have #LIVED and
the #BEAUTY that you have #CREATED.

- WHEN: you have found yourself, you will Find The Others.
- WHEN: you have found The Others, you will find yourself.

- DO_NOT: try to "convince" others
- DO_NOT: WORRY ABOUT "results"

- YOU: Keep injecting Beauty, with the obsessiveness, patience and
commitment of a warrior. AT YOUR OWN PACE with 0% effort, but don't #PUSH
 it.

::: tip RULE
if it #FEELS #CORRECT keep moving forward. Otherwise, #TEST something different.
:::

#### OBSERVE: funny "coincidences" or strong synchronicities
  - OR: interesting people that suddenly appear in your life
  - OR: even soulmates that you begin to attract to yourself
  - LAUGH: about them, after all, the Universe might be a big work of #ART

#### IGNORE: "opposition" or "defiance" to "prove" your newly found "powers"
  - KEEP: ON #SHINING
  - KEEP: ON #CREATING
  - KEEP: ON #SHARING

#### IGNORE: the external and internal "demons" (doubts, fears and disbeliefs)
  - REALIZE: they will soon #VANISH into thin air.

#### SHOW: #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to your #PATH
  - BE: 120% sure that if you #CREATE this with all your #MIND, #BODY, #SOUL #NATURE will #REMOVE #IMPOSSIBLE #OBSTACLES.
  - TRUST: Don't trust us or believe us: #TEST it for #YOURSELF.
  - REMEMBER: #NEVER do anything #ILLEGAL and/or against your own #CONSCIOUSNESS.

---
### The Process

1. #QUESTION #EVERYTHING
  - don't just believe anything you read on this site, past, present or future.
2. #TEST
  - Test your assumptions.
3. #LAUGH
  - Laugh about results.
4. #SHARE
  - Share with #OTHERS what you have learned/created/discovered.
5. #REPEAT

- Less Syntactics, More Semantics.

::: tip NOTE
We don't aim to find the 'best' solution, as there might be infinite ways to achieve a single goal.
:::

## #STEPS

Now that you've gotten all the way here in the instructions. This is the point where
you start taking steps.  Make sure to take one step at a time, and not to skip anything.

### STEP A: DUMMIES
The first step is to make a dummies version of the #IDEA that a 5 year old could
understand. This is where it get's a bit complicated because nobody can tell you
what the idea is. You decide what the idea is that we are talking about. That is how you learn.

##### Making a FOR-DUMMIES edition

> IDEA: #IMAGINE AND/OR #CREATE

What does it mean to imagine and/or create something? If you were going to create something
what ideas would you have? If you were going to create something what would be born
out of the imagination.

::: tip NOTE
These versions would be as if they were being explained to a five
year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form
possible.
:::

#### #MESSAGES
Develop Information Messages from previous step. Once you have your idea/create
to a form where it can be explained to a 5 year old we are then going to develop information messages.

These information messages will be used as tweets, comments, and replies to various
artifacts that are found on the Internet/Reality.

::: tip NOTE
The options below are possible locations to seed your #MAKE messages.
:::

Some of the possible options you could use from your Information Messages are:
- YOUTUBE: Comments, Replies, Videos
- BLOGS: Writing Blog entries
- TWITTER: tweets, replies, retweets
- INSTAGRAM: Posts, Stories, Replies
- OTHER: #UNKNOWN social networks

#### #MESSENGERS
WHEN the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist #FAMILY and  #FRIENDS
inviting them to share, observe, and watch these messages.

##### #FRIENDS
When you have your messages it is time to sit down and make a list of #FRIENDS that you'd like to
include in these messages. What we like to do is tailor the messages to types of friends. Most
people have varying groups of friends who's interests span cooking to video games.

So it's important to tailor your messages to each FRIEND you are including as a #MESSENGER

##### #FAMILY
After you have built your #FRIENDS messengers next is to make the same list of #FAMILY members
that you'd like to include as #MESSENGERS.

Once again you want to make sure to tailor your messages to each person you are including as a
messenger to ensure that the messages is received and understood.  

::: danger TROLLING
Trolling could be detrimental to the messages let’s avoid trolling
and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing
at a time until the message is completed.
:::

::: tip NOTE
To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects
that are already prone to the idea.
:::

After this, the message may be easier to reach people with the most
followers. Let’s spread the message #EVERYWHERE.

### #ENGAGEMENT
When both the #MESSENGERS and the #MESSAGES are ready an awareness marathon will
start with #MESSENGERS posting the prepared general public messages.

::: tip #MESSENGERS could:
- Replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
- Use common #HASHTAGS
- Encouraged to #SHARE the #MESSAGES
:::

::: warning NOTE
The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions
:::

## #WHO
### Who are the Artists
- SOMEONE: who excels at #IMAGINATION
- SOMEONE: who excels at #CURIOSITY
- SOMEONE: who has a #PASSION and follows it no matter what.
- SOMEONE: who #CREATES worlds that other people inhabit.
- SOMEONE: who #FIGHTS for The #GOOD, The #BEAUTIFUL and The #JUST.
- SOMEONE: who #SHARES for the #LOVE of #SHARING.
- SOMEONE: who #SHINES at influencing #PERSONS, #SYSTEMS, #IDEAS, and #BELIEFS.
- SOMEONE: who leaves the world a better place.
- SOMEONE: who obsessively pursues a #TARGET until its final #CONSEQUENCES.
- SOMEONE: who absolutely never never ever gives up.
- SOMEONE: who does much with so little.

## #ORGANIZING
Here is The Formula for a self-organizing society
1. FIND... knowledge.
2. PRESENT... this knowledge in a beautiful way.
3. GIVE... others the power to do something with this knowledge.

::: warning NOTE
These three ingredients will create organic change. As each person is
educated to the truth, they will share it with others, and they will all act
on this truth in a beautiful way. Thus, beauty and truth will multiply.
:::

## #ART
The process to creating the #ART

- INSPIRE: #ART
- IMAGINE: #ART
- CREATE: #ART

::: warning NOTE
#ART likes to be both literal and figurative. Many people can’t get
past the literal interpretation in order to understand the deeper, hidden
meanings in the allegory. As with the #ART of the ancients, the #ART of
today also has deeper meanings.
:::

As the #ART spreads, and evolves, more people will become immersed in the #ART
you create. In this way, a new #REALITY, a new #SOCIETY, a new #UNIVERSE can be
built up from the very foundations of your #IMAGINATION.

Through practice the individual is taught and trained to visualize themselves
into a new #CREATIVE #FUTURE.

As the #ART develops much like a self-organizing system. The #ART will
connect to its immediate environment through #FAMILY, #FRIENDS, and #SOCIALNetworks.
Thus organizing the surrounding environment to complete THE POSITIVE END.

The #ART is within you, and all around you; it can be disguised as anything,
and everything. In a way, to participate in the #ART, is like experiencing a
living story, where the universe #BUILDS itself around the #ART.

The #ART is thus a living, breathing, entity... an experience, a mystery, a
mythology, a new reality. The #ART is a thought of #AWAKENING.

It is the only #STORY worth telling; the only #STORY that has ever been told,
the #STORY of #ETERNITY.

To draw, paint, sculpt, design, write, act, sing and dance the #ART into
existence. It will be through #US that the event takes place; for this #ART
consumes all reality within itself; this object is #ART, not a physical
object, which draws all things towards itself.

## #PROTOCOLS
::: warning NOTE
We want to be copied because we believe that there is no limit to
how many #IDEAS there can be in the #WORLD. Below are some instructions on
how to do it. Of course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We
want to share our experiences.
:::

1. Remember to smile. Just, never be sad in general.

2. Throw a party with friends. Cook some food if you like, play music,
create #ART.

  - IF: you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or cafe that you
  can meet in.

  - GATHER: #FRIENDS with various creative/artistic skills.

  - BECOME: #FRIENDS with artists, painters, musicians, poets, etc.

  - LOVE: your friends. Without them, everything fails.

3. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.

  - NOTE: In the event that you have to "present" on the fly. Make sure
  that you have a few easy-to remember facts to back up your statements.

  - NOTE: Statements are not only for stating things. Statements also makes
  things harder to forget. By sending out messages of events, activities and
  other tips you make them unforgettable and eternal.


4. Invent vocabularies.
  - MAKE: #MUSIC together even if it is strange
  - MAKE: #ART together even if it is strange
  - MAKE: #POETRY together even if it is strange
  - MAKE: #REALITY together even if it is strange
  - MAKE: #DANCE together even if it is strange

  - NOTE: Make sure your friends know also how to have fun, since otherwise
  you won't get anything done. #IDEAS are not rocket science, so just spread
  out skills.


  - NOTE: Do not have principles for selecting beforehand whom you speak to.
  Build trust, and make sure you work together.

5. Create a #GIANT #Twitter network.

  - NOTE: Whenever you tweet something, have people retweet it, and ask their
  friends to retweet it. Always strive for deep tweets. Get in the habit of
  making your tweets very descriptive but concise, so people do not have to
  click a link to know if they are interested or not.

6. Don't be obsessed with doing things "right".

  - NOTE: Instead of thinking too much, tinker instead. Proceed by way of
  experimentation, try things out. If they fail, make sure to laugh a little,
  then try a different way.

  - NOTE: Learn from the mistakes.

  - NOTE: Do not be afraid to appear temporarily foolish.

7. Totally go for it fearlessly, while sparking and nurturing collective
inspired creative inventions and spontaneous depths of strategic #FUN.

8. Talk to people where ever you go, and tell them about what you are doing.

9. Be #OPEN with everything you do.

10. #SHARE all knowledge freely with the others.

11. Throw more #PARTIES

12. Transform into the #RealityArtist you know you were meant to be.
